## ABOUT THE GAME
Mobitangga Legends: Dor Dor is an 'ala-ala' of Snake&Ladder game. It can actually be played for 5 players, but the project's specification says 3 or 4 players is enough. Each player will start from Petak 1 and finish at the final Petak. While in the game, players can use their skill, buff, and move to another Petak using Teleporter. The game will end if we have one player who has reached the final Petak. For further information, please check our documentation.
